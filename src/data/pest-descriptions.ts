export const DESCRIPTIONS: Record<string, { biology?: string; lifeCycle?: string; habitat?: string; behavior?: string }> = {
  ants: {
    biology: "Social insects living in colonies with queens and workers; trails appear along edges and foundation lines.",
    lifeCycle: "Complete metamorphosis (egg–larva–pupa–adult); activity spikes in warm months and after rain.",
    habitat: "Soil near slabs, mulch beds, cracks/crevices; forage into kitchens/baths for sweets and proteins.",
    behavior: "Follow pheromone trails; satellite colonies relocate when disturbed. Baiting and exterior barriers are effective."
  },
  spiders: {
    biology: "Predatory arachnids feeding on other insects; most local species are harmless.",
    lifeCycle: "Gradual development; seasonal population swings based on available prey.",
    habitat: "Eaves, soffits, garages, basements; webs collect around lights and corners.",
    behavior: "Attracted to lighted areas with insect activity; web removal plus perimeter treatments reduce numbers."
  },
  roaches: {
    biology: "Nocturnal scavengers; German cockroach indoors, other species often start outdoors.",
    lifeCycle: "Egg cases (oothecae) hatch into nymphs; reproduction can be rapid in warm, humid spaces.",
    habitat: "Kitchens, bathrooms, mechanical spaces; moisture and clutter increase pressure.",
    behavior: "Hide in tight cracks; respond well to sanitation, crack-and-crevice baits, and growth regulators."
  },
  wasps: {
    biology: "Social or solitary; paper wasps, yellowjackets, hornets common locally.",
    lifeCycle: "Annual colonies started by a single queen in spring; peak size late summer.",
    habitat: "Eaves, play structures, shrubs; ground nests for some species.",
    behavior: "Defensive near nests; regular web/wasp sweeps and nest removal keep areas clear."
  },
  mice: {
    biology: "Small rodents with rapid reproduction; excellent climbers.",
    lifeCycle: "Litters every 3–4 weeks in favorable conditions.",
    habitat: "Attics, crawl spaces, garages; entry through gaps larger than 1/4 inch.",
    behavior: "Nocturnal; follow rub marks and edges. Exclusion + sanitation + targeted baiting/trapping."
  },
  termites: {
    biology: "Subterranean termites common in KS/MO; feed on cellulose (wood, paper).",
    lifeCycle: "Colonies with workers, soldiers, reproductives; swarmers appear in spring.",
    habitat: "Soil contact with wood; moisture around foundations increases risk.",
    behavior: "Travel through mud tubes; long-term protection via bait systems or soil treatments."
  }
